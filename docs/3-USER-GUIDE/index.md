## Which Feature for Which Task?

```
Task: "I want to explore a topic with follow-ups"
→ Use: Chat (add sources, select context, have conversation)

Task: "I want one comprehensive answer"
→ Use: Search / Ask (system finds relevant content)

Task: "I want to extract the same info from many sources"
→ Use: Transformations (define template, apply to all)

Task: "I want summaries of all my sources"
→ Use: Transformations (with built-in summary template)

Task: "I want to share my research in audio form"
→ Use: Podcasts (create speakers, generate episode)

Task: "I want to find that quote I remember"
→ Use: Search / Text Search (keyword matching)

Task: "I'm exploring a concept without knowing exact words"
→ Use: Search / Vector Search (semantic similarity)
```

## Quick-Start Checklist: First 15 Minutes

**Step 1: Create a Notebook (1 min)**
- Name: Something descriptive ("Q1 Market Research", "AI Safety Papers", etc.)
- Description: 1-2 sentences about what you're researching
- This is your research container

**Step 2: Add Your First Source (3 min)**
- Pick one: PDF, web link, or text
- Follow [Adding Sources](adding-sources.md)
- Wait for processing (usually 30-60 seconds)

**Step 3: Chat About It (3 min)**
- Go to Chat
- Select your source (set context to "Full Content")
- Ask a simple question: "What are the main points?"
- See AI respond with citations

**Step 4: Save Insight as Note (2 min)**
- Good response? Click "Save as Note"
- Name it something useful ("Main points from source X")
- Now you have a captured insight

**Step 5: Explore More (6 min)**
- Add another source
- Chat about both together
- Ask a question that compares them
- Follow up with clarifying questions

**Done!** You've used the core workflow: notebook → sources → chat → notes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Adding everything to one notebook | No isolation between projects | Create separate notebooks for different topics |
| Expecting AI to know your context | Questions get generic answers | Describe your research focus in chat context |
| Forgetting to cite sources | You can't verify claims | Click citations to check source chunks |
| Using Chat for one-time questions | Slower than Ask | Use Ask for comprehensive Q&A, Chat for exploration |
| Adding huge PDFs without chunking | Slow processing, poor search | Break into multiple smaller sources if possible |
| Using same context for all chats | Expensive, unfocused | Adjust context level for each chat |
| Ignoring vector search | Only finding exact keywords | Use vector search to explore conceptually |

## Next Steps

1. **Follow each guide** in order (sources → notes → chat → podcasts → search)
2. **Create your first notebook** with real content
3. **Practice each feature** with your own research
4. **Return to CORE-CONCEPTS** if you need to understand the "why"
